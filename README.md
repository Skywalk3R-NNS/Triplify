# Triplify

Triplify is an expense-splitting web-application that allows users to create disposable groups that have a live-location sharing feature for their trips. Whether you are traveling with friends, family, or strangers, Triplify makes it easy to split bills, track expenses, and share your location with your group members.

Triplify was built using Java, Spring Boot and React JS. It applied the concepts of SOLID principles, use of cohesion and coupling, refactoring techniques, design patterns, and test-driven development.

## Features

- Create and join groups with a unique code
- Add expenses and split them evenly or by percentage
- View the balance and transactions of each group member
- Settle debts with one-click payment options
- Share your live location with your group members
- Chat with your group members in real-time
- Customize your profile and group settings
